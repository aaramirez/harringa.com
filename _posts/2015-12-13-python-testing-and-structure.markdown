I've been working a little more on my [Raspberry Pi Temperature Monitor][pi-temp-monitor] and wanted to check out how to do some 
[Test-driven Development][TDD]. So, I started by looking into how I might write some tests and structure my code and ran into 
[this guide][py-guide] which was quite informative. I think it turned out alright (though I'm sure things may have evolved since 2009, 
when the guide was written. Like anything else, the could can be refactored and improved incrementally.
